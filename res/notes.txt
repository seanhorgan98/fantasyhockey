Need to decide what to do about the app bar. Takes up lots of room and may not be necessary
Without it the design may look a little weird though.
Premier League fantasy app doesn't have one though so should be fine.

App Page Layout:
["Log In",
 "My Team",
    "Transfer Page",
 "League", 
 "Stats", 
    "Player Stats", 
    "Fixtures & Results", 
    "Rules"
]
